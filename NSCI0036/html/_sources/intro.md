# Introduction

This workbook contains all the required material for the module NSCI0036. Before starting work you need to set up your Cocalc account by following the instructions in the section [Getting Started](getting-started).

## How to Interact with the Material

For the first five weeks you will be working through the material in the 'Programming with Python' section. Each week there are the following activities to complete:

### 1. Notes

Work through the notes and complete the embedded exercises. Solutions are provided for you to check your understanding.

It is recommended that you do this **before** attending the workshop.

### 2. Workshop

The workshops lead you through some examples of practical programming in Science. Work on these during your timetabled practical classes.

### 3. Exercises

Work on the exercises during and after class.

## Collaboration

You are encouraged to work on the non-assessed material in pairs. Effective collaboration is a key learning outcome for this module, so do experiment with Cocalc's collaboration features.
