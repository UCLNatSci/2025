    "The [Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction), or BZ reaction, is a chemical reaction which exhibits non-equilbrium dynamics. Under certain conditions, the BZ reaction results in oscillatory behaviour, as demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMF4RjiITGM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The BZ reaction can be modelled by the following equations, where $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are the concentrations of the two reactants X (red) and Y (colourless) at timestep $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "X_{i+1} &= X_i + k_1-k_2X_i + k_3X_i^2Y_i\\\\\n",
    "Y_{i+1} &= Y_i + k_4X_i - k_3X_i^2Y_i\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_1=0.2$, $k_2 = 0.4$, $k_3 = 0.1$ and $k_4 = 0.3$. The initial concentrations are zero and each timestep has a duration of one second.   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write code to calculate $X_i$ and $Y_i$ for the first $300$ seconds. (Hint: you can use your answer to {numref}`exercise_2_8` as a template).\n",
    "2. On on set of axes, plot a graph of $X$ and $Y$ against time, an in another on another plot $Y$ against $X$. Check that your plots look like the examples below. Notice how both $X$ and $Y$ reach a steady-state.\n",
    "2. Keeping the other parameters fixed, experiment with different values of $k_1$ between $0.1$ and $0.3$. For what range of values of $k_1$ does the reaction reach a steady-state, and for which values dos it exhibit sustained oscillations?\n",
